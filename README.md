Submitted by Aston Smith How the script works and the code book describing the variables

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Goals
Create a tidy data set
Create a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
Create a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. A README.md file must be included in the repo that explains how the scriptS are connected.
Analysis R Script - run_analysis.R
